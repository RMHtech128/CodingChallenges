This is a repository of my recent coding challenge results. 
I write code for the fun of it, and decided to put them in a centralized repo.

This is my code. 100%. (Yes, you will see some terminology or variable names from other people solutions, because I do my research
online... I would expect any programmer to do their own due-dillegence, and read/review what other's have done before them. 
Let's not reinvent the wheel!)

My code is not perfect. I often write this code for fun and then other priorities get in the way of "clean-up" and solid refactoring. It open for critique, code reviews, etc for learning and growing best practices.

Due to limitations on the number of files allowed for this repo, you will find the class files only.
The visual studio projects, solutions, dll references, configs, etc are excluded.
